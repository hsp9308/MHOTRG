1. Libraries needed

- ITensor 3.1.11 (https://github.com/ITensor/ITensor)
- Complex bessel function (https://github.com/joeydumont/complex_bessel)
- Intel MKL 2018 or later


2. How to compile 

(1) Install the libraries above (make sure that Intel MKL is correctly linked in the ITensor installation)
LIBRARY_PATH=(path/to/intel/version)/linux/compiler/lib/intel64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_intel_thread -lmkl_core -liomp5 -lpthread -lm -ldl
INCLUDE_PATH=(path/to/intel/version)/linux/mkl/include

* INCLUDE_PATH may be different in the later version (i.e. intel oneapi)
** You may use openmp, or GNU lapack library with pthread. 


(2) modify the Makefile;
- Correct the variable LIBRARY_DIR to one's itensor installation directory.
- You may need to specify the installation location of complex bessel function library.

(3) Done!
If you want to calculate the partition function of your desired one, you can change the parameters of hotrg function. 
Description about the parameter is in the code file.
